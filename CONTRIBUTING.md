# Contributing to OAAX examples

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OAAX examples! We welcome contributions from the community to improve the examples and make them more useful for everyone.

Before you start contributing, please take a moment to read through [OAAX general CONTRIBUTING document](https://github.com/OAAX-standard/OAAX/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). It sets out the guidelines for contributing to OAAX projects, including code style, commit message format, and other important information.

## How to contribute

OAAX examples are designed to be easy to use and understand. If you have an idea for a new example, would like to improve an existing one, have suggestions for enhancements, or report bugs, please follow these steps:
1. **Open an issue** in the repository to discuss your idea or improvement.
2. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your changes.
3. **Make your changes** and commit them with a clear message.
4. **Push your changes** to your forked repository.
5. **Submit a pull request** to the main repository for review.

## Contribution ideas

If you're looking for ideas on what to contribute, here are a few suggestions:

### Parallel models
Add an example that demonstrates how to run multiple models in parallel using the OAAX runtime.

### Python example
Add an example that demonstrates how to use the OAAX runtime in Python. This could include a simple model inference example or a more complex use case.

### Multiple runtimes
Add an example that demonstrates how to use multiple runtimes in a single application to run inference on different hardware platforms.

### Model-specific examples
Add examples that demonstrate how to use specific models with the OAAX runtime. This could include popular models like YOLO, ResNet, RF-DETR, or ViT.

### Chaining models
Add an example that demonstrates how to chain multiple models together to create a more complex inference pipeline. For example, you could create a pipeline that first runs an object detection model and then runs a classification model on the detected objects.

### Simple end-to-end example

Add a simple end-to-end example that demonstrates how to use the OAAX runtime in a simple application from video retrieval to model inference. This could include a simple web application that allows users to upload a video and run inference on it using the OAAX runtime.
